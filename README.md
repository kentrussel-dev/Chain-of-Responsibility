# Chain-of-Responsibility

Automated Waste Management System
Background: Municipalities and cities face significant challenges in managing and efficiently disposing of waste. Traditional waste collection methods often result in delays, inefficiencies, and high operational costs. An innovative solution is needed to automate the waste management process, ensuring timely collection and disposal while optimizing resource utilization.
Objective: Develop an automated waste management system that uses a chain of responsibility pattern to ensure efficient waste collection and disposal. The system should handle different types of waste containers and trigger appropriate disposal actions based on the type and capacity of each container.
